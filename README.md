# Superscalar Reduced Instruction Set Computer

## Course Project - CS 683 - Advanced Computer Architecture

## *Course Instructor - Prof. Virendra Singh*

### This repository contains our design of a 2-way out-of-order superscalar architecture and consists of all the Design Documents, Testbenches and Hardware Descriptions in **VHDL**

### Instruction Set Architecture Specification

It is the same as **17** instructions supported by the [**IITB-RISC-22**](https://github.com/rohankalbag/multicycle-risc), their encoding can be found in the [Problem Statement](https://github.com/rohankalbag/Multicycle-RISC-Microprocessor/blob/master/Documentation/Multicycle%20Problem%20Statement.pdf).

## Software Requirements

- [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)
